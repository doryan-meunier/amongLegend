Queue IDs
Queue IDs show up in several places throughout the API and are used to indicate which kind of match was played. A full list of queue ids can be found in queues.json.
Note: In early 2022, URF (previously queueId 900) was divided into separate queues— ARURF (queueId 900) and Pick URF (queueId 1900). All Pick URF games from before this distinction will still be in queueId 900.
